## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Description

The most important part of this project is the Navbar, which is created using mainly JavaScript logic. Also it is responsive across all main devices.

## Dependencies

This project does use google font to make the website a little prettier, but other than that it is vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
